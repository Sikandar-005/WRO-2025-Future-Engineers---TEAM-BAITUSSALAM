This repository presents our self-made robotic system, designed acoording to the WRO 2025 (Future Engineers) theme challenge. We use a combination of different mechanics, smart sensors, different algorithms, and autonomous decision-making to solve a real-world problem through a functional, scalable prototype.

# TEAM INTRODUCTION

# Who are we?

We are a passionate and creative team of young innovators representing our school/country in the WRO 2025 Future Engineers category. Driven by curiosity and a shared vision for a better future, we bring together skills in robotics, programming, engineering design, and teamwork to solve real-world challenges.

Our team thrives on collaboration, critical thinking, and hands-on problem-solving. Each of us contributes unique strengths‚Äîwhether it's coding intelligent algorithms, designing 3D printable components, optimizing hardware integration, or fine-tuning sensors. Together, we are building more than just a robot‚Äîwe are building solutions that matter.

With a strong belief in learning by doing, we‚Äôve embraced cutting-edge technologies such as ROS2, IMUs, line sensors, and custom-designed 3D parts to meet the demands of the competition.

We are not just participants‚Äîwe are future engineers preparing to shape the world.
# üåç Where do we come from(The participants)?

We are a team of aspiring engineers from different cities across Pakistan, brought together by a common passion for robotics and innovation. What unites us is Jamia Baitussalam ‚Äî an institute where modern science and classical education go hand in hand.

At Jamia Baitussalam, we‚Äôre not just students ‚Äî we‚Äôre innovators. The institution fosters a unique blend of Islamic education, modern sciences, and cutting-edge technology. With access to state-of-the-art robotics labs, 3D printing, programming, and AI resources, we are encouraged to explore, invent, and lead.

Our journey in WRO 2025 is a reflection of what Baitussalam stands for: bridging the gap between tradition and technology, and empowering youth to become ethical, forward-thinking engineers of tomorrow.

# üöÄ Our Journey üåü

We are three teammates ‚Äî Taha Umer, Zulqarnain, and Sikandar ‚Äî bound together by friendship, teamwork, and a shared passion for technology. We study at Jamia Baitussalam Talagang, an Islamic institute that nurtures both academic excellence and strong moral values.

Our journey began with a simple idea: to step into the world of robotics and engineering through the WRO 2025 Future Engineers challenge. With limited resources but unlimited determination, we started from simple programmes ‚Äî learning new tools, exploring new technologies, and understanding the real-world applications of robotics.

Along the way, we faced challenges that tested our patience and problem-solving skills ‚Äî from mechanical design issues to fine-tuning code for better performance. Each challenge became a stepping stone, making our team stronger and our project better.

This repository is the record of our progress ‚Äî the designs, the code, the experiments, and the lessons learned. For us, this is more than a competition; it‚Äôs a journey of growth, learning, and teamwork. And we‚Äôre just getting started.

# Mobility Management üõû
# 1. Vehicle Movement Management
The robot‚Äôs movements are controlled through a rear-wheel drive system powered by Pololu 25D Metal Gearmotor(25mm Brushed DC Gearmotor with Encoder Option) and a front steering mechanism servo-based Ackermann.
Motor speed and steering angle are managed using PWM signals from the Raspberry Pi, with feedback from the QTR sensor array and IMU for precise control.
# Steering Mechanism

Ackerman steering mechanism<img width="809" height="434" alt="image (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/822befb1-dbc8-469c-be05-a470986c1154" />
 The Ackermann steering The Ackermann steering geometry in the center of the mechanism ensures that both front wheels turn at angles that allow them to follow concentric paths during a turn. This is achieved by angling the steering linkages inward toward the rear axle, so when the central steering arm moves, it causes the inner wheel to turn more sharply than the outer one. As a result, the extended lines from both wheels intersect at the rear axle center, minimizing tire slippage and improving cornering efficiency. This setup is especially useful in vehicles or robotic platforms that require precise and smooth turning.
