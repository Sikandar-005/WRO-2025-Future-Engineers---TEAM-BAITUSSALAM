# WRO 2025 Future Engineers ‚Äì TEAM BAITUSSALAM

This repository presents our self-made robotic system, designed acoording to the WRO 2025 (Future Engineers) theme challenge. We use a combination of different mechanics, smart sensors, different algorithms, and autonomous decision-making to solve a real-world problem through a functional, scalable prototype.

# WHO ARE WE?

We are a passionate and creative team of young innovators representing our school/country in the WRO 2025 Future Engineers category. Driven by curiosity and a shared vision for a better future, we bring together skills in robotics, programming, engineering design, and teamwork to solve real-world challenges.

Our team thrives on collaboration, critical thinking, and hands-on problem-solving. Each of us contributes unique strengths‚Äîwhether it's coding intelligent algorithms, designing 3D printable components, optimizing hardware integration, or fine-tuning sensors. Together, we are building more than just a robot‚Äîwe are building solutions that matter.

With a strong belief in learning by doing, we‚Äôve embraced cutting-edge technologies such as ROS2, IMUs, line sensors, and custom-designed 3D parts to meet the demands of the competition.

We are not just participants‚Äîwe are future engineers preparing to shape the world.
# üåç Where DO WE COME FROM(The participants)?

We are a team of aspiring engineers from different cities across Pakistan, brought together by a common passion for robotics and innovation. What unites us is Jamia Baitussalam ‚Äî an institute where modern science and classical education go hand in hand.

At Jamia Baitussalam, we‚Äôre not just students ‚Äî we‚Äôre innovators. The institution fosters a unique blend of Islamic education, modern sciences, and cutting-edge technology. With access to state-of-the-art robotics labs, 3D printing, programming, and AI resources, we are encouraged to explore, invent, and lead.

Our journey in WRO 2025 is a reflection of what Baitussalam stands for: bridging the gap between tradition and technology, and empowering youth to become ethical, forward-thinking engineers of tomorrow.
