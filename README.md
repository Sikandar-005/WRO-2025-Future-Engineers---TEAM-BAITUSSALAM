# WRO 2025 Future Engineers â€“ TEAM BAITUSSALAM
This repository presents our self-made robotic system, designed acoording to the WRO 2025 (Future Engineers) theme challenge. We use a combination of different mechanics, smart sensors, different algorithms, and autonomous decision-making to solve a real-world problem through a functional, scalable prototype.
