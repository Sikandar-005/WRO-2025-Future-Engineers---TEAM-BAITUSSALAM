# WRO 2025 Future Engineers – TEAM BAITUSSALAM
This repository presents our self-made robotic system, designed acoording to the WRO 2025 (Future Engineers) theme challenge. We use a combination of different mechanics, smart sensors, different algorithms, and autonomous decision-making to solve a real-world problem through a functional, scalable prototype.
# WHO ARE WE?
We are a passionate and creative team of young innovators representing our school/country in the WRO 2025 Future Engineers category. Driven by curiosity and a shared vision for a better future, we bring together skills in robotics, programming, engineering design, and teamwork to solve real-world challenges.

Our team thrives on collaboration, critical thinking, and hands-on problem-solving. Each of us contributes unique strengths—whether it's coding intelligent algorithms, designing 3D printable components, optimizing hardware integration, or fine-tuning sensors. Together, we are building more than just a robot—we are building solutions that matter.

With a strong belief in learning by doing, we’ve embraced cutting-edge technologies such as ROS2, IMUs, line sensors, and custom-designed 3D parts to meet the demands of the competition.

We are not just participants—we are future engineers preparing to shape the world.
