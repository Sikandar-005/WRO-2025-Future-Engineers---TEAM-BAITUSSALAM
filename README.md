# TEAM INTRODUCTION

# Who are we?
We are a team from Pakistan, representing our country and institute in WRO 25(Future Engineers). Our team consists of three memembers-Taha Umer, Zulqarnain, and Sikandar.
It is our first time participating in the WORLD ROBOT OLYMPIAD.

# üöÄ Our Journey üåü
Our journey of WRO dates long back to the time when we were first introduced to 'Robotics'. Robotics not only helped us in learning programming and different mechanisms but also taught us many skills like problem-solving, decision-making, patience, and many more. Annyways, now let me take you through our journey of WRO. We started working on this project as soon as we were informed about our participation in it, by our management. It has not been long yet, since we started working. Our jouney is full of problems, hurddles, headaches, and even pessimism but what makes our journey interesting are the moments of success, solving the impossible problems, and fighting against our fate and acheiving 'THE VICTORY'. Our journey yet continues and brings more hurdles. More updates soon...


# Mobility Management üõû
# 1. Vehicle Movement Management
The robot‚Äôs movements are controlled through a rear-wheel drive system powered by Pololu 25D Metal Gearmotor(25mm Brushed DC Gearmotor with Encoder Option) and a front steering mechanism servo-based Ackermann.
Motor speed and steering angle are managed using PWM signals from the Raspberry Pi, with feedback from the QTR sensor array and IMU for precise control.
# Steering Mechanism

# Ackerman steering mechanism<img width="809" height="434" alt="image (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/822befb1-dbc8-469c-be05-a470986c1154" />
The Ackermann steering geometry in the center of the mechanism ensures that both front wheels turn at angles that allow them to follow concentric paths during a turn. This is achieved by angling the steering linkages inward toward the rear axle, so when the central steering arm moves, it causes the inner wheel to turn more sharply than the outer one. As a result, the extended lines from both wheels intersect at the rear axle center, minimizing tire slippage and improving cornering efficiency. This setup is especially useful in vehicles or robotic platforms that require precise and smooth turning.


# 2. Motor Selection

|-------|----------------|
| ![DC Gear motor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/288496ce-5f6e-454b-8fb5-fd1dce2e9569) | ‚Ä¢ Type: Pololu 25D Metal Gearmotor(25mm Brushed DC Gearmotor with Encoder Option) ‚Ä¢ Voltage: 12 V <br> ‚Ä¢ No-load Speed: ~300 RPM‚Ä¢ Stall Torque: ~11 kg¬∑cm <br> ‚Ä¢ Stall Current: ~5 A <br>‚Ä¢ Encoder: 48-CPR quadrature, ~1632 counts/rev after gearbox|

These motors provide the necessary torque for overcoming ramps and obstacles, while the encoders enable accurate distance measurement and closed-loop speed control. 
  



Selection Criteria:
- Torque sufficient for acceleration and climbing inclines
- RPM matched to required top speed for the track
- Low power consumption for extended run time
Implementation: Motors are mounted to custom 3D-printed brackets, connected to 5mm G2 pulleys and a 200 mm closed-loop timing belt driving the rear wheels.
