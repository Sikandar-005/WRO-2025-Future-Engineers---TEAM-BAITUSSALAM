This repository presents our self-made robotic system, designed acoording to the WRO 2025 (Future Engineers) theme challenge. We use a combination of different mechanics, smart sensors, different algorithms, and autonomous decision-making to solve a real-world problem through a functional, scalable prototype.

# Who are we?

We are a passionate and creative team of young innovators representing our school/country in the WRO 2025 Future Engineers category. Driven by curiosity and a shared vision for a better future, we bring together skills in robotics, programming, engineering design, and teamwork to solve real-world challenges.

Our team thrives on collaboration, critical thinking, and hands-on problem-solving. Each of us contributes unique strengths‚Äîwhether it's coding intelligent algorithms, designing 3D printable components, optimizing hardware integration, or fine-tuning sensors. Together, we are building more than just a robot‚Äîwe are building solutions that matter.

With a strong belief in learning by doing, we‚Äôve embraced cutting-edge technologies such as ROS2, IMUs, line sensors, and custom-designed 3D parts to meet the demands of the competition.

We are not just participants‚Äîwe are future engineers preparing to shape the world.
# üåç Where do we come from(The participants)?

We are a team of aspiring engineers from different cities across Pakistan, brought together by a common passion for robotics and innovation. What unites us is Jamia Baitussalam ‚Äî an institute where modern science and classical education go hand in hand.

At Jamia Baitussalam, we‚Äôre not just students ‚Äî we‚Äôre innovators. The institution fosters a unique blend of Islamic education, modern sciences, and cutting-edge technology. With access to state-of-the-art robotics labs, 3D printing, programming, and AI resources, we are encouraged to explore, invent, and lead.

Our journey in WRO 2025 is a reflection of what Baitussalam stands for: bridging the gap between tradition and technology, and empowering youth to become ethical, forward-thinking engineers of tomorrow.

# üöÄ Our Journey üåü

We are three teammates ‚Äî Taha Umer, Zulqarnain, and Sikandar ‚Äî bound together by friendship, teamwork, and a shared passion for technology. We study at Jamia Baitussalam Talagang, an Islamic institute that nurtures both academic excellence and strong moral values.

Our journey began with a simple idea: to step into the world of robotics and engineering through the WRO 2025 Future Engineers challenge. With limited resources but unlimited determination, we started from simple programmes ‚Äî learning new tools, exploring new technologies, and understanding the real-world applications of robotics.

Along the way, we faced challenges that tested our patience and problem-solving skills ‚Äî from mechanical design issues to fine-tuning code for better performance. Each challenge became a stepping stone, making our team stronger and our project better.

This repository is the record of our progress ‚Äî the designs, the code, the experiments, and the lessons learned. For us, this is more than a competition; it‚Äôs a journey of growth, learning, and teamwork. And we‚Äôre just getting started.

# Hardware and Components
Raspberry pi 5

The Raspberry Pi 5 is a compact, single-board computer released in October 2023, offering a major performance boost over the Pi 4. It features a 2.4 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 CPU, VideoCore VII GPU, supports up to 8 GB LPDDR4X RAM, and has dual 4Kp60 HDMI output, USB 3.0, PCIe 2.0 expansion, and a faster microSD interface. It also includes dedicated power management, real-time clock, and better camera/display connectivity, making it ideal for AI, robotics, and media projects.

Raspberry pi Camera Module

For our WRO Future Engineers robot, we are using the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 to enable vision-based functions such as object detection, line following, and navigation. Its adjustable-focus lens and high-resolution imaging allow the robot to process visual data accurately in real time, which is crucial for tasks that require precision and adaptability during the competition.


MPU-3250

![MPU-3250](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8154028-0de9-4fd7-9c22-bdc2e1b53ec4)

The MPU-3250 is a compact motion-tracking sensor that integrates a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer in a single chip, allowing it to measure angular velocity and linear acceleration along three perpendicular axes. It communicates primarily via the I¬≤C interface, making it easy to connect with microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Operating on low power and supporting both 3.3V and 5V (depending on the breakout board), it is commonly used in robotics, drones, and other embedded systems for orientation detection, stabilization, and motion control. Its small size and combined sensing capabilities make it suitable for projects requiring accurate movement and tilt measurement in real time.

GT2 pulley and timing belt

![Gt2 pulley and timing belt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f114bbc2-4523-4d2e-b8ea-52cbe363f821)

The GT2 pulley and timing belt drive uses one pulley on the motor and another on a rod connected to both rear wheels, transferring motion precisely without slippage. It is lightweight, compact, quiet, low-maintenance, and absorbs shocks. Compared to differentials, chain drives, and gears, it is simpler, lighter, quieter, and easier to align, making it ideal for our WRO Future Engineers robot where both rear wheels need to move together for stability and efficiency.

DC Gear motor

![DC Gear motor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6dd3591-e93e-451e-b14c-a7cabe141219)

This is a DC gear motor with a built-in gearbox to reduce speed and increase torque. It provides strong, controlled rotation for robotics applications, making it suitable for driving wheels or mechanisms that require both power and precision. The attached connector allows easy wiring to motor drivers or controllers.
